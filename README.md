# hello-world
new beginnings in 2018
Hi World!
Where to start... I'm new to all of the this, meaning the tech world. Even though I'm nervouse I'm excited for this new opportuinity.
I studied biolody in college, got a pretty decent gig in retail management but now wanting something more. A change of pace. Looking forward to the upcoming grueling weeks... but LET'S GET IT!!!!
